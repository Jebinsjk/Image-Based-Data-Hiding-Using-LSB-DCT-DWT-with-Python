# Image-Based-Data-Hiding-Using-LSB-DCT-DWT-with-Python


The project investigates the effectiveness of three prominent image-based data hiding
techniques: Least Significant Bit (LSB), Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), and Discrete
Wavelet Transform (DWT). The primary aim is to enhance the security and capacity of
steganographic methods through the implementation of these techniques in Python. Each
method was evaluated for its robustness against potential attacks, with a focus on their
respective strengths and weaknesses.
Results demonstrate that while LSB excels in terms of simplicity and speed, both DCT and
DWT significantly outperform it in terms of resilience against various forms of data
extraction attacks. The findings suggest that hybrid approaches, which combine multiple
techniques, may provide an optimal solution for secure data embedding, aligning with
contemporary research advocating for such integrative strategies in steganography
